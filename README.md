# This is a Clock app written in C.


# TODO
- [x] Make code more modular with header files and stuff
- [x] Make the clockhand rotate along the middle circle
- [ ] Render text of the time on the renderer
- [ ] Add an hour and minute clockhand 
- [ ] tick() function only handles seconds make it handle minute and hour


# Structure of the project

Every clock component (clockhand, clock body, time label) all of it will be a component structure
Maybe the time label structure will have a seperate struct def but clockhand and clock body can share the same structure
